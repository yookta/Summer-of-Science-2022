# Stellar Astrophysics

I will be adding Stellar Astrophysics Resources here so that you can follow these through.

## Week 1: Basic Stellar structure and Stellar evolution
This is part of a Coursera course "Imagining Other Earths" that you can start off with.
Topics Are-
[Stellar Structure and Evolution](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/life-on-other-planets/stellar-structure-RQwB8?utm_source=link&utm_medium=page_share&utm_content=vlp&utm_campaign=top_button) 

Another course "The Evolving Universe" had these two lectures on [Stellar Structure Basics](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/evolvinguniverse/stellar-structure-basics-P0KRZ?utm_source=link&utm_medium=page_share&utm_content=vlp&utm_campaign=top_button) and [Stellar Evolution After the Main Sequence](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/evolvinguniverse/stellar-evolution-after-the-main-sequence-x4ceK?utm_source=link&utm_medium=page_share&utm_content=vlp&utm_campaign=top_button)


This is a complete lecture on **An Introduction to Stellar Astrophysics** about an hour and half long, so make sure to complete this -[An Introduction to Stellar Astrophysics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-NUDjgUFZU)

These are some interesting Youtube videos that you can watch as well:
- [Star Clusters and Stellar Evolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsRSlYFnq3k)
- [Stellar Evolution Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnpL_-9YQGg)

## Week 2: Stellar surface abundances, Stellar surface structures

- [Stars 101 | National Geographic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFO_bsg1sw8)

These are some pretty interesting articles on stellar abundances that you can read up.

- [Stellar Abundances](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/physics-and-astronomy/stellar-abundances)
- [EQUATIONS OF STELLAR STRUCTURE](https://www.astro.princeton.edu/~gk/A403/stellar.pdf)
- [Stellar Granulation and the Structure of Stellar Surfaces](https://www.eso.org/sci/publications/messenger/archive/no.32-jun83/messenger-no32-15-20.pdf)
- [Stellar structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_structure)

## Week 3: Mass loss, White dwarfs, Planetary nebulae, Supernovae, Low mass stars
You can check these links to get a basic idea.
- [Planetary Nebula](https://www.schoolsobservatory.org/learn/astro/stars/cycle/planetary)
- [Low mass star](https://lco.global/spacebook/stars/low-mass-star/)

A **supernova** is a powerful and luminous stellar explosion. This transient astronomical event occurs during the last evolutionary stages of a massive star or when a white dwarf is triggered into runaway nuclear fusion.

## Week 6: Black Holes,
This is far by the most interesting topic that I have enjoyed personally. There are tons of introductory videos that are avaliable out there and you can watch any of those as they have equally good animation, some of these I've linked below:

- [Black Holes Explained – From Birth to Death](https://youtu.be/e-P5IFTqB98)
- [The Ultimate Guide to Black Holes](https://youtu.be/QqsLTNkzvaY)
- [Black Holes: Crash Course Astronomy #33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZWPBKULkdQ)

Further, you can read about types of black holes from [here](https://spaceandbeyondbox.com/the-different-types-of-black-holes-and-how-they-form/). You can also read from these super nice blogs:

- [Black Holes | Swin Astronomy](https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/B/Black+Hole)
- [Black Holes | NASA](https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/black-holes)

## Week 7: Binary Stars, Neutron Stars, Gamma-ray Bursts, Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram, Spectral Types
For the wrap up, it's good to check out what the ongoing research in dark matter is. You can checkout these links which are a repository so you can read *some* of the articles that catch your eye.

- [Gamma Ray Burst](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLykC1VN7NY)
- [NASA | What Are Gamma Rays?](https://youtu.be/PPlrtgilgK8)

A neutron star is the collapsed core of a massive supergiant star, which had a total mass of between 10 and 25 solar masses, possibly more if the star was especially metal-rich. Except for black holes, and some hypothetical objects (e.g. white holes, quark stars, and strange stars), neutron stars are the smallest and densest currently known class of stellar objects. Start with the Wiki article and then follow the articles/ videos!
