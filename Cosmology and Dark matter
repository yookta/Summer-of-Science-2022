# Cosmology and Dark Matter

I will be adding Cosmology and Dark Matter Resources week wise here so that you can follow these through.

## Week 1: Big Bang, Higgs Boson, The Accelerating Universe
This is a Coursera course [From the Big Bang to Dark Energy](https://www.coursera.org/learn/big-bang) that you can start off with. Focus on completing Week - 1 and Week - 2 (You can audit the course easily).

This is a complete lecture on **The accelerating Universe** by Brain Schmidt and is about an hour long, so make sure to complete this - [The accelerating Universe](https://youtu.be/55pcpTjd3BY)

These are some interesting introducting Youtube videos that you can watch as well:
- [The Beginning of Everything -- The Big Bang](https://youtu.be/wNDGgL73ihY)
- [Origins of the Universe 101 | National Geographic](https://youtu.be/HdPzOWlLrbE)
- [How Do We Know The Universe Is ACCELERATING?](https://youtu.be/tXkBfkeJJ5c)
- [What is the universe expanding into? - Sajan Saini](https://youtu.be/6PiyUjVxukI)

## Week 2: Introduction to Dark Energy and Dark Matter
For an introduction to dark matter and dark energy, these are some really cool animations which you can watch.

- [What is Dark Matter and Dark Energy?](https://youtu.be/QAa2O_8wBUQ)
- [Dark matter: The matter we can't see - James Gillies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HneiEA1B8ks)
- [Dark Matter: Crash Course Astronomy #41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9W3RsaWuCuE)
- [The search for dark matter -- and what we've found so far | Risa Wechsler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQMLFryA_7k)

These are some pretty interesting articles on dark matter that you can read up.

- [Dark Energy, Dark Matter](https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/what-is-dark-energy)
- [Dark Matter](https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/d/Dark+Matter)
- [5 Things That We Know and Don't Know about Dark Matter](https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2020/03/13/5-thing-we-know-about-dark-matter-and-5-we-dont/?sh=2c48779736f8)
- [Mathematical Model May Explain What Dark Matter Consists Of](https://scitechdaily.com/mathematical-model-may-explain-what-dark-matter-consists-of/#:~:text=Astrophysicists%20have%20calculated%20that%2080,the%20rotation%20speed%20of%20galaxies.)

## Week 3: Introduction to Neutrinos
You can check these links to get a basic idea about **Neutrinos**.
- [Why neutrinos matter - Sílvia Bravo Gallart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkydJXigkRE)
- [What is a Neutrino and Why Does it Matter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SOCVLidD-c)
- [Neutrino](https://neutrinos.fnal.gov/whats-a-neutrino/)
- [LiveScience | Neutrino](https://www.livescience.com/64827-neutrinos.html)

This [Documentary - Neutrino Sun Particles - What Are Neutrinos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0RMnp3t46A) is a bit long but you can watch if you are interested.


## Week 4: Gravitational Lensing
Checkout these resources for reading gravitional lensing.

- [Gravitional Lensing](https://hubblesite.org/contents/articles/gravitational-lensing)
- [Gravitational lensing | AAS](https://www.science.org.au/curious/space-time/gravitational-lensing)
- [WHAT IS GRAVITATIONAL LENSING?](https://sci.esa.int/web/euclid/-/what-is-gravitational-lensing-)
- [Gravitional Lensing](https://youtu.be/4Z71RtwoOas)

Some theoritical links for gravitional lensing:

- [Gravitational Lensing Theory](http://spiff.rit.edu/classes/phys240/lectures/grav_lens/grav_lens.html)

## Week 5: The Cosmic Microwave Background, WIMPs and Supersymmetry

- [Beyond WIMPs: Exploring Alternative Theories Of Dark Matter](https://www.universetoday.com/127971/weighing-dark-matter/)

## Week 6: Black Holes
This is far by the most interesting topic that I have enjoyed personally. There are tons of introductory videos that are avaliable out there and you can watch any of those as they have equally good animation, some of these I've linked below:

- [Black Holes Explained – From Birth to Death](https://youtu.be/e-P5IFTqB98)
- [The Ultimate Guide to Black Holes](https://youtu.be/QqsLTNkzvaY)
- [Black Holes: Crash Course Astronomy #33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZWPBKULkdQ)

Further, you can read about types of black holes from [here](https://spaceandbeyondbox.com/the-different-types-of-black-holes-and-how-they-form/). You can also read from these super nice blogs:

- [Black Holes | Swin Astronomy](https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/B/Black+Hole)
- [Black Holes | NASA](https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/black-holes)

## Week 7: Wrap Up!
For the wrap up, it's good to check out what the ongoing research in dark matter is. You can checkout these links which are a repository so you can read *some* of the articles that catch your eye.
